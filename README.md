### About the ZyraX Home main controller

The ZyraX Home platform is designed for **modularity and extensibility**, allowing developers to integrate custom devices, extend automation logic, and interface with external APIs.

The vision of the ZyraX Home system is to provide a high-end, fully integrated smart home experience. Every component, from lighting and sensors to automations and third-party devices/services, will work seamlessly together under a single platform, creating a unified, intelligent home environment. The system aims to combine luxury, flexibility, and advanced functionality, making it easy for users to manage and expand their smart home setup while ensuring reliability and performance.

This main ZyraX Home controller serves as the central interface and management hub for all connected components. It supports integration of modules such as RF sensors, automations and LED strips, with additional modules currently in development.  

The controller software is cross-platform and can run on Windows and Linux systems, though a Raspberry Pi is recommended for deployment. This repository includes software and documentation for the main controller.

## 3. Getting Started (Raspberry Pi 4 - Raspbian OS)

These instructions provide an overview for setting up and running the ZyraX Home main controller application.

> Note: While the application is compatible with Windows, a Linux environment is recommended for optimal performance.

### 3.1 Connect RF receiver to Raspberry Pi OS (optional)

Use the schematic to connect the RF receiver to the Raspberry Pi, to be able to connect RF sensors to the system.

![schematic](documentation/hardware/schematic_v0_1.png)

### 3.2 Make Raspberry Pi OS ready

1. Flash the [Raspi OS Lite (64-bit)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) image on the SD card (with the imager):
    - Configure OS:
        * Hostname: `mastercontroller`
        * Username: `ZyraXHome`
        * Password: Use a strong password (At least one upper case character, one lowercase character, one number and one symbol. At least 8 characters long.)
        * Using Wifi:
            * SSID: Network with internet
            * Password: Password of that network (To connect to a hidden WiFi network after flashing, use `sudo raspi-config nonint do_wifi_ssid_passphrase "SSID" "PASSWORD" 1`)
        * Enable SSH.
2. Boot Raspberry Pi and [connect with ssh](https://www.putty.org/).
    - Use `mastercontroller.local`
    - Or to find IP:
        * Connect to a monitor with HDMI, login and then: `ifconfig`
        * Install [Advanced IP scanner](https://www.advanced-ip-scanner.com/en/) and do a network scan. Make sure to use the right IP range.

### 3.3 Install application

1. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/LukedeMunk/zyrax-home-main-controller/releases).
2. Run `install.sh`:
    - `sudo sh install.sh`
    - Unexpected end of file error? -> `sudo dos2unix install.sh`
3. Navigate to [mastercontroller.local](mastercontroller.local)
4. (Optional) To configure the weather API, check [Visual Crossing website](https://github.com/LukedeMunk/zyrax-home-main-controller/releases).
4. (Optional) To configure the Telegram alarm messages, check the [Telegram](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api) documentation.

## 4. Configure RF sensors (optional)

A few RF sensors have been tested, but any 433â€¯MHz sensor should work. On the configuration page, you can select the model that matches your sensor, map its RF codes, and use the sensor in automations or with the alarm.

## 5. Configure ledstrips (optional)

To add new [RGBW LED strip controllers](https://github.com/LukedeMunk/zyrax-home-rgbw-ledstrip-controller/releases) to the system, please boot the LED controller (with a compatible firmware version) and connect it to the same network as the main controller.

At the configuration page -> Add device -> Choose device or choose `My accessory is not shown here` -> Configure options -> Configure LED addressing
